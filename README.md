# Cutoff List

The program asks the number of students and the number of subjects.
Then it asks the user to enter the names followed by the respective marks.
In case of some human mistake in input, you can re-fill the previous names and marks by entering "redo" in name input.
After the input, the program takes the sum of all the marks, and gives average marks.
The program asks user for Cutoff marks, and then outputs a list of all the students who cleared the cutoff in descending order along with the grades.

The grades given are:
     A+ = >=95%
     A  = >=90%
     B+ = >=85%
     B  = >=80%
     C+ = >=75%
     C  = >=70%     
     D  = >=60%
     E  = >=50%
     F  = >=0%
